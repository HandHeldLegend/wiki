The long potion of the amplifier will go to the back of the console, and the four points will sit right next to the points we added flux to

Tack one point to hold it in place, and adjust as needed

Once you have the four points on the front of the motherboard soldered, you can flip the console over and begin on the long point. Begin by applying flux just like on the front points.&#x20;

Finally you can tin the two pads that your speaker will connect to, and then solder the speaker into place.&#x20;
