## Shell Modifications

[General shell trimming tips](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/oem-and-non-ips-gba-shells-trim-guide)

This kit requires extensive cutting of the shell in order to make the micro HDMI port accessible from outside of the shell. You will have to cut both halves of the shell, however the back portion will have less cuts. We reccomend using a dremel tool to remove a bulk of the material, and an exacto knife to clean it up.&#x20;

Everything highlighted in red will need to be cut in order for the display to fit within the shell

## Testing

Once you have soldered your connections to the board, you can preform one more dry test to ensure that audio is passing through the HDMI port, as well as testing that the buttons function to adjust brightness.&#x20;

If everything is functioning as expected, go ahead and complete the reassembly by replacing the rear screws. [See our disassembly guide if you need further assistance here.](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/agb-disassembly-guide)
