Do you know how to fix a GBC?

Let’s take a look at your board. Below is a list that will hopefully point you in the right direction. This isn’t an exhaustive guide as it’s limited to 2200 characters by IG but it will cover the most common issue. It also assumes you have a multimeter, a “tri-wing” screwdriver, and can open the GBC.

*Batteries*
We know it’s obvious but are the batteries good? If so, check the battery contacts for any corrosion. When cleaning corrosion you want to brush White Distilled Vinegar on the affected area then clean off with Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) preferably 97-99% pure. 70% from the drugstore has too much water in it and may short something when you add the batteries.

*Power Switch*
Using a multimeter, set it to continuity mode (icon with the waves), remove the batteries, and put the switch in the OFF position. Touch a probe to Pin 1 & Pin C. If you hear a beep, you got a connection. Repeat in the ON position, probing Pin 3 & Pin C. If no beeps, then load a cotton swab with IPA dripping it into the switch opening by the nub. Quickly moving the switch back and forth will scratch up the internal plates. Recheck the pins. Beep? You should fully clean the switch more. If not you need to replace the switch. We recommend watching a video on both as it's something better seen than described.

*DC Jack*
Time to check pins 2 and 3 of the jack. BT- passes through the jack. This is so the connection can be blocked if plugged in. Dirt and oxidation can block it too. Load a cotton swab with IPA and drip it into the port. Using a cheap toothbrush scrub the walls of the port. DO NOT poke anything hard as you can break the center pin.

*Fuse*
Quick check of F1 with the multimeter and get a beep. If it’s blown you’ll need to replace it but it likely blew for a reason so check your board fully for shorts.

*Power regulators*
Used to provide stability to the system extra regulators work w/o the stock board still attached. We have the Clean Power and the Robot\_Retro regulator.
