## Install Guide

### Optional Soldering

If you are choosing to use the buttons for your install, then you will need to begin by soldering wires to the flex cable. Remember to use flux while doing so, and be sure to check out our [soldering guide](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/soldering-iron-guide) if you are having trouble.&#x20;

The wires will then get ran to their designated test spots, this may be easier to do with the ribbon inserted into the console.&#x20;

![](../../assets/wAHkBrpo0CJf5yyi6-0bx_wiring-guide.jpg)

We also recommend putting kapton tape over the motherboard pins that you won't be using, this is to prevent accidental shorts or anything like that.&#x20;

![](../../assets/ecMUffx5BlWD6TqyYCbOT_2.jpg)

Once you've finished up your soldering and taped the extra connector, you can begin the get the shell ready.&#x20;

There is one piece of plastic that will need to be removed from the shell before the motherboard can sit down into place. Use your fingers to snap the piece of plastic out of the link port area before reassembling.&#x20;

Now, the shell is ready for you to begin reassembly!

Start by putting the screen into the shell, make sure it is flush with the shell, if you don't then you may feel a lip of the shell around the screen.

Place the bracket down on top of the screen, and then feed the bottom of your ribbon cable down to the "Nintendo" logo area, this is where the touch sensor is located. Connect the ribbon cable of the screen to the flex cable that connects to the motherboard. Finally, if you have this available, put a trimmed down piece of foam over the touch sensor but below the alignment bracket, this is to hold the touch sensor against the front of the console. You can also use [Kapton tape](https://handheldlegend.com/products/kapton-tape?_pos=1&_sid=6245b0b27&_ss=r) in place of foam.

If everything is functioning as expected, go ahead and complete the reassembly by replacing the rear screws. [See our disassembly guide if you need further assistance here.](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/agb-disassembly-guide)

## Using the OSD

The on screen display has multiple adjustable options including brightness, color, display mode, and frame blending.&#x20;

To access the OSD all you have to do is long touch the touch sensor. Alternatively if you have the wires soldered for buttons press select, left and right bumper, all at the same time.&#x20;

![](../../assets/pepvI1rfaATO78yr84ZIR_osd-menu.png)

Using the OSD is simple with the touch sensor, tap the Nintendo logo once to change the highlighted setting. Long hold the touch sensor a second time to swap which setting you are changing. Finally to exit the OSD you can hold the touch sensor for about ten seconds, or let the menu time out on its own.&#x20;
