### Right Joycon

For this guide we will be starting with the right joycon. We will first take out the four Y00 screws on the back of the controller.

From here we can use a pry tool to seperate the back of the controller from the front. Open the joycon like a book carefully, there are two ribbon cables that connect the front and back halves of the shell.&#x20;

Now we need to unplug the battery, simply pull up on the connector and it should release.&#x20;

Now we have to pry the battery out of the console, use a soft pry tool and be sure not to damage the battery, as this can start a lithium fire.&#x20;

Now that the battery is out, we can remove the three golden double zero phillips head screws.&#x20;

Now the middle bracket is free, however there is a ribbon cable attached to it, so be careful when moving it around.  The ribbon cable can be disconnected by lifting the locking tab on the connector.&#x20;

Now we have access to the joystick, we can remove the two golden phillips head screws and unlatch the connector on the joystick. The stick then just pulls out of the controller.&#x20;

Now we can insert the new Gulikit stick, and repeat the entire assembly process in reverse to assemble the controller again.&#x20;

### Left Joycon

This process is fairly similar to the right joycons, starting off with the four Y00 screws on the back.&#x20;

Carefully open the Joycon like a book to keep the ribbon cables safe

Now we need to disconnect the battery just like the other controller

Pry the battery out with a soft plastic spudger, be sure not to damage the battery&#x20;

Next up we have three golden phillips double zero screws

There is a ribbon cable connecting the middle frame piece, be careful not to rip the cable.&#x20;

Unclip the ribbon cable from the connector revealing the stick and the one remaining ribbon cable covering its screw. Undo that clip and you can swap out the stick just like the other joycon.&#x20;

Repeat the process in reverse with the new stick and you have a completed joycon install!&#x20;
