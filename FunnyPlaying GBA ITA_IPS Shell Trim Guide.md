### IPS kit with V2/V3 Bracket

If you have purchased a GBA IPS LCD kit from HHL and are using either a [V2 bracket](https://handheldlegend.com/collections/game-boy-advance-gba/products/game-boy-advance-ips-v2-lcd-bracket?variant=31757890912390) or [V3 bracket](https://handheldlegend.com/collections/game-boy-advance-gba/products/game-boy-advance-ips-v3-lcd-bracket?variant=39312269377670), you will need to make cuts on the shell circled below:

After you have made the proper modifications, we suggest using sandpaper to smooth out any cuts made on the shell to avoid any damage to the IPS or ITA kit that will be installed.&#x20;
