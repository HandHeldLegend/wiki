To start we will assume that you have disassembled the console down to the main motherboard. Lay the RetroGlow pcb over top of the console and align the points.&#x20;

We recommend securing the board down with some kapton tape to stop it from moving around too much while soldering.&#x20;

Next apply some flux and begin soldering. All the points highlighted in red will need to be soldered. If you are adding and IPS screen, you can solder the brightness button to the point labeled BRGHT.&#x20;

This is an example of the brightness button wire from an IPS ribbon soldered to the point BRGHT on the Retroglow:

You can test if it works by placing the battery against the contacts on the back of the console before reassembly.

If all the leds turn on then you can proceed onto final reassembly!&#x20;
