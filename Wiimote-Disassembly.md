## Disassembly

To disassemble the wiimote you must first remove the batteries and battery door. From there you can remove the four tri-wing screws from the back of the controller.&#x20;

When the screws are removed the only thing holding the controller together at this point are two clips near the top of the controller. We recomend using a plastic pry tool to seperate the two sides, you may need to use slight force but do not break any of the plastic.&#x20;

If you are not getting the controller apart by prying one side, switch to the other side of the controller and repeat until it comes apart. Notice the clips on either side.&#x20;

Once the two halves of the controller are apart you can begin to take the controller out of the shell.&#x20;

### Rumble And B Button Bracket

The board can be unclipped from the bracket, freeing the motherboard. Before ripping the motherboard from the shell, free the rumble motor from the bracket that holds the membrane for the B button. You will have to unclip the wires from the bracket itself.&#x20;

Once the rumble motor has been freed, you have fully disassembled your Wiimote!
