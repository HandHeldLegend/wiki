# Using New On Screen Menu

Hold **Start + 2 + Left **to get into the menu. **Left** and **2** move the menu **left** and **right**, and **Start** goes **in** and **out** of menu.

## Installation Guide

This guide is for the new V2 version of the Cleanscreen PCB and flex cables. The V1 boards are identical in install, except you no longer a need to solder HSYNC or VSYNC, and instead you also need to send DAT4 to ground if using our IPS (latest) LCD, or 5V if using a TFT LCD.&#x20;

Finally, send DAT5 to ground by default, and if you get color issues that toggling the 1CHIP/2CHIP switch doesn't fix, send DAT5 to 5V instead (follow [this guide](https://www.tiktok.com/@retrosix/video/7216687595500162309)).&#x20;
