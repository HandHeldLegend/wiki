## Preparing The Open Controller

To prepare the Opencontroller we may need to remove the triggers, depending on your guitar layout you may not need to remove them. This process is the same as changing the triggers which can be located [here](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/swapping-bumper-buttons-open-controller).

## Wiring Diagrams:&#x20;

*Keep in mind, the different variations of guitars will have different internals and potentially even more buttons depending which model you have. Your install will likely vary from ours. However understanding the basic principles of the mod will allow you to adapt it to any guitar.*

Wiring for this mod is extensive and we recommend different colored wires so that you don't have one mess of wires that are all the same color.&#x20;

There are three main button PCBs that have to be connected to the OpenController, the D-Pad, the Strumming buttons, and the frets for the neck of the guitar. To begin lets connect the D-Pad as it'll be the easiest to start with.&#x20;
