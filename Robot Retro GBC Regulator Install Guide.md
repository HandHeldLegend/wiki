:::hint{type="info"}
This mod will not provide the required power lines for the original and FunnyPlaying replacement screens to function. If you are choosing to use this on an OEM or FunnyPlaying screen, then you will need to cut pin 7 of the regulator and install the new one over top of the original.&#x20;

To install the regulator on top of the original regulator, place it on top and bridge solder from the pins of the original regulator to the pads of the new regulator.

Alternatively you can also remove the original regulator if you aren't planning on using a FunnyPlaying or original Gameboy Color Screen. This will mean that the board will sit totally flat.&#x20;
