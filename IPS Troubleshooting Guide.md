| Display flickers, image looks fine otherwise                                                         | Rotate the potentiometer for display voltage adjustment. This is present on all Game Boys and is typically accessible via the battery compartment.&#x20;Be sure to only turn the potentiometer screw with very gentle force. If you apply too much force you may damage the potentiometer.Reach out to us at <support@handheldlegend.com> if you're unsure where to find this adjustment location.   |
| No display on screen                                                                                 | Clean all connection points with a soft bristle brush and 99% IPA. Ensure all connections are secure and fully inserted. Go over all ribbon cables and connectors to check for damage such as ripped cables or broken connectors.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| OSD Battery indicator is not functioning                                                             | If you're using a LiPo battery mod such as CleanJuice (or any other LiPo battery mod), the battery indicator will not be accurate as it is designed to work with the voltage drop curves of standard AA batteries. This is likely functioning as intended. If you are using AA batteries, ensure that all necessary wires are soldered according to the IPS install guide for your specific product. |
| System will not boot with the IPS display plugged in                                                 | Check all connections to ensure nothing is shorting. Ensure all ribbon cables are inserted in the proper orientation. If you're still not getting power, [clean your power switch](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/power-switch-cleaning-guide) and consider [replacing the original electrolytic capacitors](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/electrolytic-re-cap-guide) for your console.           |
