Once you have trimmed these pins, use sandpaper to smooth them out to avoid any damage to the IPS kit that will be installed.  Your shell will now look like this:

With a marker, you can note the area where you will need to trim on the D-pad in order to fit the LCD. Once you have done so, remove the LCD and perform this trim of the D-Pad. After completing the necessary modifications, use sandpaper to smooth them out to avoid any damage to the IPS kit that will be installed.  Your shell will now look like this:
