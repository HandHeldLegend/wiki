| Issue                                                       | Cause                                                                                                   | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Controller not connecting when plugged in                   | You potentially may be using a power only cable, ensure it also transfers data.                         | Double check the cable that you are using, and ensure it transfers data as well as power.&#x20;                                                                                                                                           |
| Occasional disconnects on ProGCC 3                          | Potential Causes:&#xA;Bad Cable&#xA;Too Many Pro Cons connected                                         | Attempt using another USB-C cable, over time cables can become damaged from movement. &#xA;Disconnect any unused Pro Controllers from the console, removing all and adding them back one by one is a good solution.                       |
| My face buttons are swapped, A is B, B is A, X is Y, Y is X | You have rebinded the buttons on your controller.&#x20;                                                 | Enter the config website to update them back to normal. &#x20;                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Bumper buttons feel mushy                                   | Membrane placement/ Brand                                                                               | The membranes dictate the feel of the bumper buttons, you should make sure they are thoroughly seated. If you want a tougher button press then try the ExtremeRate brand membranes as they are springier than other unbranded ones.&#x20; |
| Home/Minus not pressing right/always pressing right&#x20;   | Buttons are being binded by the shell                                                                   | You can trim the shell to fix this issue, as well as adjusting the screw tightness can resolve this issue. See the [guide here](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/progcc-v3-capture-fix)                                                    |
| Rumbles are moving too much                                 | The rumbles have either come out of their adapter or the glue holding them to the shell came off.&#x20; | If you are not using an adapter to make the speaker fit into the shell, you can use cotton to fill the well that the rumbles sit in. If you are using an adapter then ensure the motor is fully seated into it.&#x20;                     |
| Sticks are acting off and not responding correctly          | The controller has lost its calibration for various reasons (specific updates, errors, etc)&#x20;       | Go to the calibration website and calibrate the sticks again.&#x20;                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Rumbles are violent even after turning down to 1%           | Your board may have a defect causing them to be over powered.                                           | Reach out to HandHeldLegend in the Discord to further troubleshoot.&#x20;                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Rumbles intermittently not turning on&#x20;                 | Damaged rumble motors                                                                                   | Contact support\@handheldlegend.com for a replacement board.&#x20;                                                                                                                                                                        |
