Is your Game Boy Advance CleanJuice battery mod **hissing **or **getting hot**? Is your board draining battery when it's not in play?

Hissing is normal when capacitors charge on initial installation. Your battery and PCB should not get hot. If you hear a sound coming from your battery, it is most likely faulty and should be replaced.&#x20;

At any point, do not continue to charge batteries that continue to hiss or get hot to the touch over time. Normal warming occurs during use for a longer period of time.
