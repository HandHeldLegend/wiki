Before you proceed...

:::hint{type="danger"}
This kit requires the removal of the EM3 resistor located right under the link port. Please be advised that this will not allow you to use the link port as originally intended after this mod.&#x20;
:::

:::hint{type="warning"}
Installing your IPS kit, bending the ribbon cables, soldering, or applying any adhesives in this kit will void the warranty and return policy. [Fully test your kit before proceeding.](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/ips-lcd-dry-test)

## Dry Testing

:::hint{type="info"}
Check our dry testing guide located [here ](https://app.archbee.io/docs/ZktAtdoYhvOAUbpe67QWW/6kptbWHa0hapfVX36t8DH)for more specific instructions.&#x20;

## Install Guide

To begin installing this kit, we will first remove the EM3 resistor from right below the link port. This will allow the video to be output through the link port.&#x20;

![After removal](../../assets/8KiFW1XkFpcLhpRW6kp9R_em3-after-removal.jpg)

Next we will solder the three wires for the normal brightness control&#x20;

Now we will solder the last two points for the A/V out.&#x20;

Once soldered, preform one more test to ensure all the buttons work to adjust brightness.&#x20;

### Start/Select Area Trim

:::hint{type="danger"}
[See our list of shell trimming guides as this step may vary depending on which shell you're using!](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/-agb-shell-trimming)

We are continually updating and adding guides to this section. For assistance, reach out to us at [support@handheldlegend.com]()
:::

*Even with pre-cut shells*, we recommend carefully examining the Start/Select area and trimming as needed. The PCB extends out past the IPS display by a milimeter or less, it can slightly vary.

See the diagram below for an example of how much you'll need to trim.

Ensure the screen is fitted into the bottom right hand side of the screen window. We recommend placing the touch sensors in these areas to allow for easy access.&#x20;

## Test and Reassemble

Ensure all the buttons are working, and that the TV out function works

![](../../assets/YczH18iKewcWu3lpTa2UN_test.jpg)

Now press select and both shoulder buttons for five seconds to switch to TV mode&#x20;

![](../../assets/Zxxc89TkF3Ail6Xrp8V1O_tvon.jpg)

If everything is functioning as expected, go ahead and complete the reassembly by replacing the rear screws. [See our disassembly guide if you need further assistance here.](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/agb-disassembly-guide)

## Troubleshooting

*   If your AV cable is not working, this may be due to a cable mix-up from the supplier. This can be resolved by swapping the pin soldered for AV out. Instead of soldering "AV" on the PCB to Pin 1, solder it to Pin 3.
