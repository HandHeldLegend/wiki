### V1.1 and V1.2 - Drains while not in use / won't hold a charge



If you are experiencing this issue, we have a solution that could help resolve the problem. Please note that that this is not a 100% guaranteed fix. If it does not work, you may notice the module gets very hot to the touch. Do not continue to use the module in this scenario. Before performing the fix, please inspect your battery for any bloating, leaking, puncture marks, etc. If the battery looks damaged in any way, do not continue to use the module.

The culprit lies with double battery protection:

If this does not resolve the issue or your battery is damaged, please contact us at support\@handheldlegend.com

### V1.2 and V1.3 - Fully Charged but indicates it is drained / module is too warm.

If you are experiencing this issue, the problem lies with an extra resistor the manufacturer added on by mistake:
