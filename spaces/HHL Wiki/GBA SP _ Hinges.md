To avoid breaking your hinges during the installation process, make sure hinges are inserted in an open shell position. Closed shell position will result in the hinge going in half way and possibly breaking when force is then applied.

The best method for insertion and removal is for the shell to be on it's side and at the following open position:

Attach the hinge caps first before proceeding. We recommend using Vaseline or dialectic grease when inserting hinges into the hinge housing to help insertion and avoid breaking either the hinges or the shell.&#x20;

The hinges are keyed on both sides, so they may look symmetrical but one is just turned 180\* to fit on the oposite side and you will notice a slight difference in appearance. Note that the symmetry refers to the orientation of the metal locking tabs, not the plastic covers. Color of hinge does not matter.
