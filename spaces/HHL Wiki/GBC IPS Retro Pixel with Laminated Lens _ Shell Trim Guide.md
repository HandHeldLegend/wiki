# *PLEASE READ*

**We highly recommend purchasing **[**the pre-cut shells from FunnyPlaying**](https://handheldlegend.com/collections/game-boy-color-gbc-shells/products/funnyplaying-game-boy-color-retro-pixel-ips-shell?variant=39833187975302)** to avoid pressure issues caused by trimming the shell yourself. As **[**per our policy**](https://handheldlegend.com/policies/refund-policy)**, once an LCD kit has been installed, it no longer qualifies for replacements.
**

**This trim is necessary for all shells except for the one designed for this kit **[**by FunnyPlaying.**](https://handheldlegend.com/collections/game-boy-color-gbc-shells/products/funnyplaying-game-boy-color-retro-pixel-ips-shell?variant=39833187975302)** You will want to ensure that the modified space for the LCD with the pre-adhered lens as precise as possible to try and avoid any damage to the LCD kit.**

First, ensure you have all the components to the kit. This includes the LCD with lens, touch ribbon, large ribbon, static film, 2 long wires, and 1 short wire. Please note that the size and shape of the touch ribbon may vary but functions the same.&#x20;

Begin with trimming the area needed for the LCD with the pre-adhered lens if you are not using the recommended shell.

Gently place the LCD face down into the front of the shell. This is going to help with how we will trim the shell.

You can also use any form of tape to keep it in place when modifying the shell for the most accurate cut. Then make small marks on where the Lens adhesives meet the edge of the LCD.

With those marks, we can draw vertical lines from these marks on both sides, to show where the shell will need to be cut. We used tape as a guide but you can also use a ruler for the most accurate results.

Now we can start cutting right down the lines on each side, as well as the top part up to the lip, as shown below.&#x20;

After making those 3 cuts, you should be able to gently bend the frame out to make sure you did it right but DO NOT pull it out just yet.

Finish the bottom cut right up to the lip just like you did up top, and now with all the cuts made, you should be able to pop the cut frame right out. Your shell will now look similar to what you see below.&#x20;

Now on the inside of the shell, the bottom lip is going to need some slight trimming as well. Using whichever tool at your disposal, we are going to remove that lip so that it is flush with shell. See the next couple images on what we are going for.&#x20;

Now take the lens again, and attempt a test placement into the shell the correct way to see how we did. If there is any resistance/blockage, DO NOT force it in. Simply remove it, see where some more trimming/adjustments are needed, and then try again.&#x20;

Inside view below. Ensure the small ribbon from the LCD doesn't get caught on anything when your doing this test fit in the shell.&#x20;

Once you are certain the above modifications are complete, please very lightly sand down any edges you may see in the cut to ensure the plastic from the shell does not damage the LCD with the pre-adhered lens.
