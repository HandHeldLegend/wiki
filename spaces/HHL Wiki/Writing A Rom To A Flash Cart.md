Flashing A Cartridge

First plug your flash cartridge into your flashing tool, make sure the pins are facing the metal contacts on the tool.&#x20;

First, download the drivers for your specific flash tool. For our specific tool it/s the CH341 driver. Just click install and it will automatically install the required driver for the GBxCart RW Tool.&#x20;

Now that we have drivers installed, plug your flashing device into your PC. Open FlashGBX, the program we will be using to flash the homebrew ROM files to your cartridge. You'll see a black command prompt open, then your program will open.&#x20;

Next you will need to select if you are flashing a Gameboy game or a Gameboy Advance game. Since the versions that we sell are Gameboy games, we will select that one.

Upon clicking your cartridge version, all your options will highlight and the information on the left will populate

In order to write a new rom to your cartridge, you will first need to select which cart you have in the bottom left, we will be using a 512kb FerranteCrafts cart, so we will select that one from the list.

Now you have the option of backing up the ROM, as well as writing a new ROM. We will select "Write ROM"

This will open up a new box for you to chose which homebrew ROM you want to flash, in this example we will be using a testing ROM

That will immediately start the upload process, followed by a check to verify that it was uploaded successful

When it's done you will get a prompt telling you it was successful, as well as how long it took to write
