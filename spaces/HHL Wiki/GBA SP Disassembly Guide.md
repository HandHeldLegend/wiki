The rear cover lifts up to reveal the main board. Remove the power switch and place it aside.&#x20;

### Main Board

Remove the 3 gold colored J0 screws holding the main board to the front shell.

Carefully tilt the main board up and away from the front shell. The display ribbon cable is still attached to the main board, which we'll remove next.

Use your plastic spudger tool to unclip the display ribbon cable.

The main board can be removed and placed aside.

### Display Assembly

Remove the buttons, membranes, speaker, and speaker cover.

&#x20;Remove the longer J0 screw hidden underneath the display ribbon cable. This screw holds down the hinge cover. Remove the hinge cover and place it aside.

Turn the console over and examine the LCD border. There are 5 screws hidden under rubber covers. Use either your plastic spudger or tweezers to lift away these rubber pads. If you want to reuse the rubber pads, take extra care to not rip or tear these pads. Having a set of spare pads on hand is recommended.

Close the clamshell lid and lift away the rear LCD cover. The LCD can be removed at this point. The ribbon cable can be carefully threaded through the front shell.

### Hinge Removal (Optional)

As an optional step, you can remove the screen hinges. There are plastic clips holding the hinges in that need to be depressed using a plastic spudger tool or a screwdriver.

Open the front LCD cover. At this point the hinges can be fully removed.&#x20;

The hinges have a small plastic cap that slides off.
