Have you recently purchased an IPS kit featuring touch sensors, only to encounter issues where the sensors are overly sensitive or consistently cycling? We have a solution for you!

Capacitive touch circuits are sensitive to human hands and electronic interference. Current running to the display, when crossing the touch sensor lines, can cause it to trigger continuously. While removing these touch sensors seems like a viable option if you no longer want the features they provide, this can sometimes cause further issues. We do not recommend doing this as altering a product in this way will void our product warranty.

## Solution

[Kapton tape](https://handheldlegend.com/products/kapton-tape?_pos=1&_sid=28b949257&_ss=r) is a high temperature polyimide adhesive tape that insulates electronic components. In these instances, we will use it to act as a barrier to prevent electrical interference to the touch sensors.

Touch sensors can either be a wire with a copper pad at the end soldered to a PCB and/or touch point or as a part of a PCB ribbon cable.

Applying a single layer of Kapton tape to the designated areas circled below should resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a second layer may be necessary.
