# Problem

The minus, plus, and capture buttons all have the potential to not feel like they are pressing correctly. This is due to the fact that we are using entirely aftermarket sets of products. If you notice that any of these buttons do not feel like they are giving a responsive click feel then this guide is for you.&#x20;

# Solutions

## Capture Button Binding

If your capture button on your ProGCC is not feeling like it should then its possible your button has a bit of plastic in the way causing it to catch and not press right. To test this, disassemble the controller down to the face plate, place the capture button in the shell and run your finger over the button on the front side. You should feel NO resistance, if you do then you need to trim the button.&#x20;

To resolve this we recommend using an exacto knife to remove a bit of the plastic from the button itself.&#x20;

You don't need to remove much plastic, just a minute of scraping at the plastic should resolve the issue. Make sure if the button is sitting in the front plate with no membranes or anything, you can press up on it and feel no resistance.&#x20;

## Minus and Plus Buttons Not Clicking

These buttons also have the potential of getting bound up by the shell, resulting in a mushy unresponsive feel of the button. This can be resolved by trimming the shell itself, wether it be an extremerate shell or an OEM style shell.&#x20;

Simply run a hobby knife over the hightlighted areas until you shave away some of the plastic. This will make enough clearance room for the button to freely move easily. You may need to keep going back and forth until you have perfect fitment.&#x20;

We have also experienced some shells where the circles for the plus and minus buttons needs to be enlargened.&#x20;
