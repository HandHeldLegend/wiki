## Video Guide

## WARNINGS:

*   **Cloud version LCD no longer has a protective film on it. A film is present if you note a clear tab sticking out from the side of the LCD. Otherwise, do not attempt to peal anything off the LCD as this results in removing the polarizer.**

*   This guide uses the Hispeedido version for install.&#x20;

*   [Test the kit before installation!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6dhyXIUBT4) Once the display is mounted it cannot always be safely removed. We ask that you test the kit by hooking it up before removing the screen protector and before fully mounting the display.

*    LCD may break if put under too much pressure or dropped. Please exercise extreme caution when installing.

*   Damage to console or LCD may occur if you do not trim the cartridge port pins. Exercise caution when trimming pins, wear eye protection to protect from pin debris when cutting the metal. Damage caused by these pins are not covered under our return or exchange policy. Trim the pins of your Gameboy's cartridge slot flat so that they don't interfere with any parts of the kit. We also recommend placing some Kapton tape over the trimmed pins to prevent any shorts.
