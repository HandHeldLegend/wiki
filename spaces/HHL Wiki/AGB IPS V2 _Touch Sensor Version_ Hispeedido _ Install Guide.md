## Before you proceed

1.  [Fully disassemble your AGB Game Boy Advance](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/agb-disassembly-guide)

2.  [Fully test your IPS kit before installation](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/ips-lcd-dry-test)

3.  [Read our IPS V2 kit guide if you want to solder the brightness controls](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/agb-ips-v2-funnyplaying-hispeedido-or-install-guide#nE_gw). The soldering points on the main board are identical to this guide.

:::hint{type="warning"}
Installing your IPS kit, bending the ribbon cables, soldering, or applying any adhesives in this kit will **void the warranty and return policy.** [Fully test your kit before proceeding.](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/ips-lcd-dry-test)

## Install Guide

### Display setup

Lay the IPS display and the included flex cable flat on your workspace. Connect the IPS display to the flex cable. Take extra caution when connecting this part; the connector is *very fragile*!

### Choose your ribbon

Look at the main board to determine which of the included FPC cables you'll need to use. There are 32 pin and 40 pin options.

![This console is a 40 pin as indicated](../../assets/PMjxnl3rs6OeTEyDJYOHk_mpc-hc64d9eovbez2s.png)

Connect the appropriate ribbon cable to the main board with the gold pins facing up away from the board. Use your fingernails or a plastic spudger to close the connector latch.

![](../../assets/GS53gyB6MJcPJCZ5vDPQq_mpc-hc64nlwgx58upc.png)

Insert the other end of the cable, dark side up, into the IPS control PCB and close the latch.

### Dry Test

Place the main board into the rear housing. Insert two AA batteries and flip the power switch. The screen should power on. Test both touch sensors to ensure all is functioning as expected. [For more details on dry testing, see this link!](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/ips-lcd-dry-test)

![Dry test success](../../assets/hDN8_KdrkWii78IRTWJvf_mpc-hc64hruiv2cbqs.jpg)

Disconnect the ribbon cable from the IPS control board for the next steps.

### Prepare IPS assembly Install

Place a strip of double sided tape on the rear side of the IPS control PCB. Adhere the PCB to the display.

### Start/Select Area Trim

:::hint{type="danger"}
[See our list of shell trimming guides as this step may vary depending on which shell you're using!](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/-agb-shell-trimming)

We are continually updating and adding guides to this section. For assistance, reach out to us at [support@handheldlegend.com]()
:::

*Even with pre-cut shells*, we recommend carefully examining the Start/Select area and trimming as needed. The PCB extends out past the IPS display by a milimeter or less, it can slightly vary.

See the diagram below for an example of how much you'll need to trim.

![](../../assets/IyOHJ-vWcFYBp_Lm8QJmy_mpc-hc64bmx11g7pnj.jpg)

### Screen Adhesive and Alignment

:::hint{type="warning"}
Optionally apply the adhesive for the display. This may make future adjustments difficult or impossible to do without **damaging the IPS display**. For this reason, we recommend other methods such as kapton tape to hold the display in place. For an overall **simpler** **and non-permenant install,** use the [3D Printed Bracket](https://handheldlegend.com/products/game-boy-advance-ips-v3-lcd-bracket) and [Dust Guard,](https://handheldlegend.com/products/game-boy-advance-ips-screen-dust-guard?_pos=2&_sid=6d546d960&_ss=r) which will have to be purchased separately from this kit.
:::

Remove the protective film from the IPS display. Install the alignment spacers along with the IPS display assembly. The IPS should sit flush against the *right* side of the housing, with the thinner alignment bracket sitting on the left hand side.

If you are using a shell you've trimmed yourself, you may use this additional alignment bracket at the bottom of the screen.

![Optional lower alignment bracket](../../assets/2DDCLlpysQHEDOndYr_bq_17optional-bracket-example.JPG)

### Install touch sensors

Peel the adhesive on the copper foil for the upper-most touch sensor. Install it on the far left of the shell cavity as shown. Route the wire away from the display cable cutout, as this can cause the sensor to activate on its own.

![](../../assets/8O1OMsPLfvCji3rTpAxNO_mpc-hc64nri491mdjb.jpg)

Perform the same step for the lower touch sensor. Install the touch sensor anywhere along the lower half of the console.&#x20;

### Install main board and insulate IPS electronics

Install the ribbon cable from the main board to the IPS control PCB.

![](../../assets/jqFMX338AE6mTcQz-BOBD_mpc-hc64zto4tp0giv.jpg)

Install the insulating film over the IPS control PCB. Use additional kapton tape as needed to secure the IPS panel and insulating film into place.

![](../../assets/5yGcVnJLppfpd74oFilvl_mpc-hc64mwmyksdgyt.jpg)

### Main board placement

Insert all face buttons, the LED indicator lens, and the button membranes.

Place the main board into the front housing, ensuring the speaker is properly aligned with the cutout in the shell. Install the 3 J1 screws to secure the main board.&#x20;

![](../../assets/SgmClN50vbtSDlQk0jluh_mpc-hc643hwefrqxem.jpg)

### Test and Reassembly

Install the power switch, shoulder buttons, and rear shell. Do not screw anything together at this point. Install batteries and power the device on. At this point, you should see the display light up. If the display is not working as expected, carefully inspect all connection points and try again.

You can control the brightness of the IPS kit by touching the lower portion of the screen area. You can change the color mode by touching the area above the screen.

If you performed the soldering steps, you can control the brightness by holding Select and pressing either L or R to increase or decrease the brightness.&#x20;

![Wait... this isn't baseball...](../../assets/nI9OiQT-XCGhNdCeSobIJ_mpc-hc64jiebhnkhs5.jpg)

If everything is functioning as expected, go ahead and complete the reassembly by replacing the rear screws. [See our disassembly guide if you need further assistance here.](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/agb-disassembly-guide)
