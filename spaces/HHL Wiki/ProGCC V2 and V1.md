## What is ProGCC V2?

This is the 2nd iteration of our ProGCC controller modification kit.&#x20;

In Smash Ultimate, many players prefer the use of a GameCube controller due to the decreased latency figures. In contrast, many players prefer the ergonomics and form of the Pro Controller. This puts a GameCube controller inside of a Pro Controller shell to offer you the benefits of both controller types.
