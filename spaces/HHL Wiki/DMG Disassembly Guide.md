## Written Guide

### Rear shell removal

Turn the Game Boy over so the battery cover is facing up. Remove the battery cover and any batteries.&#x20;

Use your Y1 screwdriver to remove the 6 screws as shown. *Some models may use PH1 screws.*

Carefully separate the front half from the rear half of the Game Boy. Note that there is a ribbon cable connecting the front shell PCB to the rear shell PCB.&#x20;

The ribbon cable can be pulled straight out of its socket. This connector is a pressure fit and does not have any locking mechanism. A small wiggling motion can be applied to persuade a stubborn cable.

### Main board removal

Remove the 4 PH1 screws holding the main board and audio filter board to the rear shell.

At this point, the main board, audio filter board, and power regulator board can all be completely removed from the rear shell.

The plastic power switch can be removed and placed aside.

### Optional: Remove cartridge shield

Unscrew the 4 PH1 screws. The metal shield will lift off with ease.

### Optional: Remove battery tabs

If your battery tabs need a good cleaning or you are moving them to a new case, you can use your plastic spuder tool to release the metal locking tab on the inside of the rear shell. There are 3 tabs in total.

### LCD/control board removal

Remove the 10 PH1 screws holding the LCD/control board to the front shell.

Note that there is a thin strip of adhesive which may produce some resistance when freeing the board from the shell. A gentle but firm lift should remove the board with ease. The main speaker is attached to the front board; mind the wires!

### Buttons and D-Pad

You now have access to remove the silicone membranes as well as the buttons.&#x20;

### Front screen lens

Pressing gently from the inside of the case, it is usually quite easy to remove the plastic screen lens. Use a cloth if you want to avoid any scratching. Gentle heat from a hair dryer can help to soften up stubborn adhesive. You may find this old adhesive to be dry and cracked. Hearing cracking noises during this step is not abnormal.

To reassemble your console, simply follow these instructions in reverse.&#x20;
