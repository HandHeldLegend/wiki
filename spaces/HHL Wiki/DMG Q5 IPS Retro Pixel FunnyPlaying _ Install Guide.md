## Install Guide

### Solder Speaker to IPS board

Solder your speaker to the new IPS control board as shown. The polarity of these wires does not matter.

### Set Up IPS Panel Assembly

Connect the IPS panel to the IPS control board as shown. This is easier done on a completely flat workspace.

![Connector fully installed](../../assets/avqc5JMvFErCl8SCIDEmz_6-ips-connected.JPG)

The rear of the flex control pcb has a small strip of adhesive. Peel the adhesive backing and stick the control board to the rear of the IPS panel as shown.

![IPS control fpc lined up](../../assets/v9sEJzRY-vTdnFvgR4YMv_8-stick-fpc.JPG)

Place the IPS display assembly into the alignment bracket. The longer portion of the flex PCB should stick out through the wide opening in the rear side of the alignment bracket as shown.

### IPS Control Board Adapter Assembly

Insert the larger ribbon cable into the larger FPC connector as shown. This is a *pressure fit* connector. Use a firm but gentle force to push this cable into place.

### Shell Modification (Optional)

Original and non-IPS ready shells: Perform steps 1 and 2.
[Prestige IPS ready shells:](https://handheldlegend.com/collections/game-boy-dmg/products/game-boy-dmg-prestige-ips-ready-shell?variant=31785169748102) Perform step 2 (enlarge the display area).
[FunnyPlaying IPS ready shell:](https://handheldlegend.com/collections/game-boy-dmg/products/funnyplaying-game-boy-dmg-ips-shell?variant=39629183484038) No modifications necessary.

### Install IPS board

Add all buttons and membranes to the front shell. Optionally, apply the screen adhesive. **We recommend *****against *****using the screen adhesive** for this particular mod as the new bracket does a wonderful job of holding the screen in position.&#x20;

Line up the holes on the alignment bracket with the screw posts on the front shell. This should be a nearly perfect fit. Take your time to ensure everything sits flush against the front of the shell. Fold the IPS board into place and ensure the speaker is fitted properly to its cutout in the shell.

![](../../assets/kHswObLBs0hZ1kkNh1a6x_13-front-board-install.JPG)

Check the adjustment wheel to ensure it sits properly in the shell. Trim any plastic that may be touching the wheel.

Install the 8 PH1 screws to hold the IPS control board in place.
