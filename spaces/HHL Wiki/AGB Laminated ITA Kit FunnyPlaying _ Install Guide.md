## Install Guide

### Soldering

If you are choosing to use the buttons for your install, then you will need to begin by soldering wires to the flex cable. Remember to use flux while doing so, and be sure to check out our [soldering guide](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/soldering-iron-guide) if you are having trouble.

We will begin by tinning the three pads on the ribbon cable, L for left, R for right, and S for select. The T point is optional if you would like to add your own touch sensor after the fact.&#x20;

We will then solder our wires onto the pads in preperation for the install.&#x20;

![](../../assets/2Oub0_XwXsvHKTbp-xcH-_solder-wires-to-points.jpg)

Your L point will connect to TP9, R will connect to TP8, S will be connect to TP2.&#x20;

![](../../assets/Y52SaZPnJs7Xz8fotJvAR_remove-c54.jpg)

40 Pin consoles should also remove C54 as per the instuctions from FunnyPlaying, we recommend leaving one leg of the capacitor soldered so that you can put it back should you ever decide to reverse the mod.&#x20;

![](../../assets/kJLrb9aIX_-PUiSYCgQl1_remove-plastic-in-link-port.jpg)

There will be a piece of plastic in the link port portion of the shell, you will need to remove it before the console will sit down into the shell. You can just snap the piece of plastic out.&#x20;

Next we will put in the ITA display, this is followed by lifting the control PCB and placing the alignment bracket below it.&#x20;

:::hint{type="warning"}
You may have to disconnect the screen to make sure everything aligns in the shell, then reattach it.&#x20;
:::



Once your alignment bracket is in place, you should place the control PCB over the bracket again before securing it down.&#x20;

Finally we can connect our motherboard to the control panel for the ITA display.

:::hint{type="warning"}
You may have to adjust the potentiometer on the back of the console near the cartridge slot to see the image on screen.
:::



We recommend taking a piece of kapton tape or similar and making sure that the touch sensor is placed firmly against the top of the shell. If it isn't then you may not be able to use the touch sensor. From this point, you can begin to put your console back together as normal.&#x20;

If everything is functioning as expected, go ahead and complete the reassembly by replacing the rear screws. [See our disassembly guide if you need further assistance here.](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/agb-disassembly-guide)
