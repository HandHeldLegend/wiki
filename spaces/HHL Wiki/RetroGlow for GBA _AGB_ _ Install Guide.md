## Written Guide:

This kit comes printed together as one large piece, you will need to use either scissors or a pair of flush cutters in order to seperate the pieces. Make sure to only cut on the dotted lines, and do not cut any traces.&#x20;

We recommend aligning the pcb and holding it in place with kapton tape while soldering.&#x20;

Solder all the points with a copper ring around them. Repeat the process on the other side of the board, there is only two points to solder on this side.&#x20;

Finally there is a long piece that will connect both halves of the console, it needs to be soldered onto the main pads on both sides.&#x20;

Once you have everything soldered, it's time for a test, place it in the bottom half of the shell and give it a test.&#x20;

If all the lights turn on, then proceed onto final reassembly.&#x20;
