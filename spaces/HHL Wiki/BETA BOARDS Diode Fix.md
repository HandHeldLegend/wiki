If you purchased a BETA board and are experiencing some disconnects then you may still have diode 3 on your board. We recommend removing it as it was removed in the final version of the boards.&#x20;

Remove the diode from the board and either bridge the pads with solder or a wire if you can't make the solder reach.&#x20;
