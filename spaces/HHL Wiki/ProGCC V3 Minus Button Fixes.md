Before preforming this modification to your membrane, verify that your buttons move smoothly and without friction in the shell. If there is any friction, refer to [this guide](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/progcc-v3-capture-button-fix) for trimming the capture button.&#x20;

The minus membrane can sometimes cause issues with the button not pressing right. If you modify the membrane by removing some of the plastic, it can improve the buttons overall feel.&#x20;

Removing the plastic until it's down to the red line can help improve the feel of the button. Alternatively you can also play with the tightness of these two particular screws, turning the screw in quarter turns can make large differences.&#x20;
