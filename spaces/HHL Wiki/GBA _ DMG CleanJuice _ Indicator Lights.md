On the PCB of the CleanJuice itself, there are 2 LEDs and colors may vary.

If the **PG** labeled light on the board is on, this means the USB cable is providing power to the system. This also means you can power your console from the USB without draining the battery - plug and play option.

If the **CHG **labeled light on the board is on, this means the USB is charging the battery. When it goes off, the battery is fully charged.

Both indicator lights will be on when module is charging. When module is fully charged, only the **PG** light will remain.

If you connect a USB cable and the **PG **light does not turn on, your cable or power supply are faulty.
