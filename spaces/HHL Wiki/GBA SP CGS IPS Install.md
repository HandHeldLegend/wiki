## Installation

The first step to installing this IPS kit is to place the screen into the top half of the shell.

From here we will connect the control PCB, this will simply plug into the black ribbon cable coming off of the screen. You know it's fully inserted when the locking tab lines up with the line on the ribbon cable.&#x20;

Now we will connect the ribbon cable that will connect to the console, this ribbon cable will go in with the gold pins facing up. Fold the ribbon cable directly behind the control PCB.

As you notice the touch sensor is hidden away in a hard to reach spot, for our install we will be relocating the touch sensor. To start take a piece of copper tape and solder a wire to it.&#x20;

Now that we have our makeshift touch sensor made, lets solder it to the control PCB. and place it on the screen so that we can easily access it.&#x20;

Now we can go ahead and fold our ribbon cable up and prepare it to be plugged into the main motherboard of the GBA.&#x20;

From here we can place the back of the shell on top of the screen and control PCB assembly.&#x20;

From here we can go head and put all the screws in for the top screen.&#x20;

From this point we can go ahead and feed the ribbon cable through the bottom portion of the shell.&#x20;

We can then place our hinges into either side of the console, if you have a black and a white hinge then the black hinge will go on the left and the white hinge will go on the right to recreate the snap shut feel.&#x20;

We can then place our buttons and membranes into the shell, as well as the hinge cover.&#x20;

Now we can connect the main PCB for the console, we will make sure the gold pins are facing up when they plug into the console.

Finally we can solder our one wire from Q12B to the KEY pad on our ribbon cable, this will allow us to control the kit through the on board brightness button.&#x20;

From here you can reassemble your console as normal!&#x20;
