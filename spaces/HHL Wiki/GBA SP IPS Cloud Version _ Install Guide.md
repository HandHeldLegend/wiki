## Shell Modifications

This kit requires a small modification of the top portion of the shell in order to make room for lens to fit into the top half of the shell. Cut along the section that is highlighted in red.

## Installation

The first thing to do after modifying the shell is to place the screen into the top half of the shell.&#x20;

Install the ribbon cable into the top port of the control board

From here fold the ribbon cable down, it can either be ran under or over the control board. It can then be looped out of the case, and the case can be screwed close.&#x20;

All that is left is soldering a wire from the flex cable to the point Q12B for brightness control
