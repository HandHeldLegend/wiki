### Problem:

Are you receiving sound through your headphones but no sound will come from the main speaker?&#x20;

Most likely this is due to the oxidization of the headphone jack. This should apply for all Game Boy Consoles.&#x20;

Pin 5 should make contact with Pin 4 when there is no headphone jack inserted. Oxidization over time can cover the pins causing those two pins to not connect, which results in a non-functioning speaker.

### Solution:

Simply insert a headphone plug into the jack, to separate the lever and pin. Then clean with 97% or higher IPA and this should fix the issue.

If the issue persists, consider replacing your speaker with a new one, especially if it is the original speaker.

You can also run a capacitor diagnostic on the console to ensure they are in working order. Capacitor diagnostic information is available for some consoles under "Console Guides" then locate your console.
