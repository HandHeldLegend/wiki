### Issue

CleanScreen cable does not have enough lead, is crooked, or is generally not fitting properly for a good connection.

### Solution

Due to the 3D printing process, this can leave extra material in the hooks of the brackets. When this extra plastic is there it will cause the cable to be pushed away from the connector. You can simply remove these extra bits of plastic to get the LCD to sit flush with the brackets and get the CleanScreen installed properly.
