## Before You Proceed

1.  [Fully disassemble your Gameboy Advance SP ](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/gba-sp-disassembly-guide)

## Install Guide

![](../../assets/XScEnVjPC_CygvJO_vQgT_1-remove-protective-film.jpg)

We will first take off the protective covering on the new screen

![](../../assets/INXknEHNcflZRTkLoeCa__2-put-screen-in-shell.jpg)

It then drops down into place, it will fit in OEM shells as well as after market shells.&#x20;

![](../../assets/CFrLs4YDjXI3SLpfOqzIO_3-fold-ribbon-cable-and-put-on-top-shell.jpg)

Now all we have to do is fold the ribbon cable away from the screen once, and place the top half of the shell onto the screen. You can also remove the very small amount of adhessive covering that is left from the factory as well.&#x20;

![](../../assets/RDD-MazQ1bgk_SErGjxFH_4-screws.jpg)

That is followed by securing the screen in place with the 5 screws for your shell. We are using our [Torx T6 screws](https://handheldlegend.com/products/torx-screw-kit-game-boy-advance-sp?_pos=1&_sid=c1e53ed80&_ss=r) for this guide.&#x20;

![](../../assets/ptRZi8C6Xe5GBtHbxE6w__5-feed-ribbon-through-shell.jpg)

From here we can move onto the bottom half of the console, first feed the ribbon cable through the shell.&#x20;

![](../../assets/qfpnwEkcIY0xek-iXjaD__6-insert-hinges.jpg)

That is followed by inserting the hinges to hold the screen to the other half of the shell.

Now we will put the hinge cover in place, and screw it down with the one screw.&#x20;

![](../../assets/KqKAj1miqe_lq5E3371YR_9-put-buttons-and-membranes-in.jpg)

The buttons, their membranes, and speaker can then be put into the console, we will then open the console to 90 degrees to make the next step easier.&#x20;

![](../../assets/04I6eahVQXOBY8JUQi4bt_10-connect-ribbon-cable.jpg)

We will connect the ribbon cable, make sure that it is completely plugged in and secure down the tabs on the side of the connector.&#x20;

![Q12B on a RetroGlow will be the brightness point](../../assets/xZU1Hbh5c0R-qAnXZubmU_11-solder-wire.jpg)

![Q12B on a stock console is in the exact same spot](../../assets/AeG8rFkscpc_n3HGtHE63_brightness-pad.jpg)

From here we will connect point Q12B to the ribbon cable, this will allow the brightness button to change the brightness as well as access the on screen display.&#x20;

![](../../assets/iKsFI-LGGwpM5PiFBjwtn_12-done.jpg)

Continue to put your console back together as normal, and you can get right to playing!&#x20;

## Functions

### On Screen Display

Long hold the brightness button to open the on screen display (OSD). Pressing the brightness button once will adjust the brightness, hold the brightness button to select the next option in the OSD. When you are done, leaving the button alone for a few seconds will close the OSD.&#x20;

### Touch Sensors

Tapping the brightness touch sensor (The one on the right of the screen) will adjust your brightness, however holding the brightness button will adjust your display mode. Holding the color mode touch sensor (Middle of the screen) will cause the color to begin to change.&#x20;
