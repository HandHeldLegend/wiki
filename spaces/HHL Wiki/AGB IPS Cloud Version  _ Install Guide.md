Next the screen just sits directly above the two alignment pieces.

From here you can add your buttons, membranes, and connect the ribbon cable to the motherboard.&#x20;

![If it is easier, you can connect it outside of the shell and then place it into the shell](../../assets/NP6mLgt4T3HoklkMLi_bp_6.jpg)

It is recomended to put a small piece of adhessive or paper in between the touch sensor and the rest of the flex cable, this is to prevent accidental changes if it comes into contact with the flex cable.&#x20;

If everything is functioning as expected, go ahead and complete the reassembly by replacing the rear screws. [See our disassembly guide if you need further assistance here.](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/agb-disassembly-guide)
