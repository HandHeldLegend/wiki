In this guide we will be going over how to install your CleanAmp Pro into your Gameboy Color.

## Install Guide

First we will remove the original speaker from our Gameboy Color.&#x20;

We will then inspect our motherboard and see if one of the required points has solder mask over it. If it does then you need to use something like tweezers to carefully scrape away some of the solder mask to allow you to solder to that point. Alternatively you can power the CleanAmp Pro by running a wire from the pad that is covered by mask, to the VCC1 via by the power switch.

We will then tin the points on the motherboard before placing the CleanAmp Pro onto the motherboard.

Now apply solder to the pads on the CleanAmp Pro and solder the board to the points. We recommend using tweezers to ensure that the points are totally flat and making good connection.&#x20;

Once all the points on the front of the PCB have been soldered, we will flip the motherboard over and tin the speaker pads on the back of the amp.&#x20;

Finally we will solder the speaker to the amplifier.

## OEM Shell Trimming

If you are planning on installing this in an OEM shell, you will need to trim away part of the screen window in order to clear room for the capacitor on the amplifier to fit. We recommend flush cutters for this job.&#x20;
