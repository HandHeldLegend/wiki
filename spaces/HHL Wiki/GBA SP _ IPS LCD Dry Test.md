[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6dhyXIUBT4)When you receive an LCD kit from us, we require that you test the kit for any noticeable defects before proceeding with your installation. This also means no soldering has been performed unless otherwise noted as necessary on the product page.

Please refer to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BJILLIecNAk) to see the method you can use for testing your LCD kit. This will help to ensure you are within[ our policy guidelines](https://handheldlegend.com/policies/refund-policy) if your LCD kit arrives damaged or is defective.
