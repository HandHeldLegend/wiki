The tactile switches preinstalled with this kit are rated around 250 grams of pressing force. We include two complimentary switches rated at 100 grams of pressing force if you desire a different button feel.

Swapping the bumper buttons is fairly simple, we recommend the following tools to get the job done:&#x20;

The first thing we will do is remove the old tactile switches. This can be done in a couple of ways. We recommend a desoldering pump to help pull the solder from the pads, however you can use solder wick as well.&#x20;

Heat up the solder with your iron, then use the pump to remove the solder as shown.

Now that we have the solder removed from the pads we can remove the buttons from the PCB.&#x20;

Next lets stick the new buttons through the back of the PCB and flip the board over to prepare soldering the pins back to the PCB.&#x20;

Finally flow solder onto the pins of the buttons.
