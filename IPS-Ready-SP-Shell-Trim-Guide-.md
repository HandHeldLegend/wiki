**This guide shows you how to trim your IPS ready shell to fit the Game Boy Advance SP IPS Backlight LCD Kit V2 - HISPEEDIDO. If you are unsure if your IPS ready shell needs to be trimmed for your IPS kit, please reach out to support at support\@handheldlegend.com**

The trim is necessary in order to fit your LCD and PCB in the top shell housing. The IPS ready shells are pre-cut for IPS kits, however, they were designed for thin FPC cables, as opposed to thicker stiff PCB's. The black PCB included with the V2 and V3 kits will have an extra piece of material around the FPC cables that will not allow for the top shell housing to close completely. Look at the photos in this guide to trim your top shell which will ensure the LCD and PCB are sitting properly and safely in the shell.
