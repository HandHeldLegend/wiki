# What is the ProGCC?

![](../../assets/HEIAuTXkmhxURyGCl9H3o_prebuilt3.jpg)

The ProGCC is a custom controller that uses the shell and ergonomics of the original Pro Controller for the Nintendo Switch. Originally it was only intended to imitate a GameCube controller and provide the benefits of the shape of the Pro Controller. This third revision boasts some impressive features over the original two versions.  This version supports Nintendo Switch, GameCube, XInput, N64, NES and SNES consoles! You also no longer need an adapter to play on the GameCube! This means that you can use your one controller on multiple consoles!&#x20;
