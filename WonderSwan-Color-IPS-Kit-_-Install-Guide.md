This is the install guide for [WonderSwan Color IPS LCD Kit.](https://handheldlegend.com/products/wonderswan-color-ips-lcd?_pos=2&_sid=38929a50f&_ss=r)

### NOTES:

*   **Test before installation! **When you receive a backlight/LCD kit, you should perform a dry run before installing to assure that nothing has been damaged in transit. A dry run or test fit means the kit is not installed in the shell. This includes the use of adhesives, brackets, and any performed soldering. For this kit specifically, soldering the two wires is required but please dry test in every other regard. All ribbon cables should have no bends or creases in them. If you are unsure how to perform a dry run, please contact our support team and we will be happy to help. Backlight kits that have been installed are not eligible for replacement or return.

*   **LCD may break** if put under too much pressure or dropped. Please exercise extreme caution when installing.

*   **Required Tools:**[ T8 Torx Screwdriver](https://handheldlegend.com/collections/tools/products/screwdriver-kit-for-nintendo-consoles-xbox-sega)
