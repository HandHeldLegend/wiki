A [Funnyplaying shell](https://handheldlegend.com/products/funnyplaying-game-boy-dmg-ips-shell?variant=39629328777350) was used in this guide which will have the viewing window pre-cut for the Q5 LCD. For all other shells. you will need to remove 1mm of plastic around the window of the shell:

Next we will want to connect the control board along the back of the bracket

Drop your new button PCB on top of the display and connect your ribbon cable before screwing the board down

*Note*: For the small ribbon, make sure the blue tab on each end of the small ribbon is facing up in the small PCB port and the large PCB port. The large ribbon will be pin side up when inserted into the front PCB and into the motherboard.

The final step is connecting the big press fit ribbon cable, it will require some delicate force in order to seat int properly
