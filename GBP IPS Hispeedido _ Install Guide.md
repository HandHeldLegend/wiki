## Before You Proceed

1.  Fully disassemble your Gameboy Pocket&#x20;

2.  Dry test your new IPS screen to check for damage

*Since soldering is required for dry testing this kit, soldering the power wire will not void the return policy. *

## Shell Modifications

If you plan on using this screen in an OEM shell, you will need to trim all the plastic highlighted in blue. Make sure to constantly check the fit of the screen, you don't want to remove too much material.&#x20;

## Installing The Mod

Once you have your shell modified, you can begin to move onto hooking the kit up to the motherboard. First we are going to solder the wires to the board.&#x20;

Once you have the wires soldered to the board, you can place the entire screen into the shell. After soldering the wires to the control board, it's time to connect them to the console. Since the Gameboy Pocket doesn't have exposed test pads like the other Gameboy variants. we will be soldering to the vias that connect to each button.&#x20;

To do this, we are going to pre-tin each wire for the install, we are then going to slide it into the via and heat the wire from the outside, allowing the solder to fill the via. Make sure not to have too much exposed wire sticking out of the other side of the board.&#x20;

Your touch sensor can be placed near the top of the case, on the side. Keep your power wire seperate from the rest as you will need to connect that to the power switch of the console. From here you can place the motherboard back into the console and screw it down.

Now all you have to do is secure the ribbon connector, and solder your power wire to the third pin on the power switch from the right. From here all you have to do is tuck the extra touch sensor at the top, and screw your console back together!&#x20;
