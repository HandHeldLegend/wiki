### Unlatch LCD

Use a plastic spudger tool or your fingernail to release the plastic bale holding the LCD ribbon cable in place. At this point we are only unlatching the cable, leave it plugged in for now.&#x20;

Take this opportunity to remove the shoulder buttons as well as the side grips. They will lift out without any resistance.

Lift the main board from the front of the console. Removing the main board from bottom to top will allow easier removal of the LCD ribbon cable.

### LCD and lens removal

Gently twist the front plastic housing. This will help free up the LCD from the front housing. At this point, the LCD should easily lift up and away.

To remove the plastic screen lens, press firmly from the inside of the console. If you would like to re-use the plastic lens, utilize a microfiber cloth to apply pressure.
