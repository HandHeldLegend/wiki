If your capture button on your ProGCC is not feeling like it should then its possible your button has a bit of plastic in the way causing it to catch and not press right. To resolve this we recommend using an exacto knife to remove a bit of the plastic from the button itself.&#x20;

You don't need to remove much plastic, just a minute of scraping at the plastic should resolve the issue. Make sure if the button is sitting in the front plate with no membranes or anything, you can press up on it and feel no resistance.&#x20;

If you still get a bad feeling click on the button then you may need to trim the shell to allow the button to have more room to move. You may need to run a razer blade along these edges in the shell, removing a small amount of plastic will help free up the button.&#x20;
