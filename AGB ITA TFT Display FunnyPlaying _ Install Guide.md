## Install Guide

### Choose your ribbon

Look at the main board to determine which of the included FPC cables you'll need to use. There are 32 pin and 40 pin options.

### Dry Testing

Connect the appropriate ribbon cable to the TFT board with the gold pins facing down. Use your fingernails or a plastic spudger to close the connector latch.

Connect the other end of the flex cable to the motherboard of the console, and secure the tabs on the connector.&#x20;

**40 Pin Console Specifics: **

The C54 capacitor will need to be removed from the board before the display will function.&#x20;
:::

![C54 Capacitor](../../assets/v_RCEW0Vf-6_QjrlZ4LVI_c54cap.jpg)

Place the main board into the rear housing. Carefully flip the panel over the board. Insert two AA batteries and flip the power switch. The screen should power on. [For more details on dry testing, see this link!](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/ips-lcd-dry-test)

![](../../assets/1BXbc81dL2--4sYg9fRq9_gba-screen-potentiometer.jpg)

On some consoles you may have to adjust the potentiometer to get the screen to function correctly. Only make small adjustments until you see the screen function as normal.&#x20;

### Modify The Shell&#x20;

:::hint{type="danger"}
[See our list of shell trimming guides as this step may vary depending on which shell you're using!](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/-agb-shell-trimming)

We are continually updating and adding guides to this section. For assistance, reach out to us at [support@handheldlegend.com]()
:::

This guide requires modifying the shell of the original Gameboy Advanced to allow room for the TFT display.&#x20;

### TFT Ready Shell

![](../../assets/J3v57TOJj6ittmzVRe85C_shell-modified.jpg)

Despite using a TFT compatible shell, we still recommend removing these two tabs of plastic with flush cutters.&#x20;

### OEM Shells

OEM shells will need more work done to them to get them to work. You will need to cut out all of the red lines in order to get your new screen into place.&#x20;

### Modify The Screen

This kit has three white tabs on the screen that will need to be removed prior to final installation. We recommend either an exacto knife or a pair of flush cutters for the job.&#x20;

### Prepare the ribbon cable for soldering

Solder the pads on the ribbon cable to the motherboard as shown below. For this mod we will need Right, Left, and Select to be soldered to the board. There is an optional touch sensor that can be soldered as well to relocate the sensor.&#x20;

![Be sure to use flux when soldering](../../assets/Qheue6FZkubsvwAe5jBrC_flux.jpg)

![We recommend securing your wires down with kapton tape](../../assets/1pPj_5v3WVUjJIizVxOSN_wireskapton.jpg)

### Test and Reassemble&#x20;

To prevent shorting on the TFT controller board, we recommend using the plastic film that came on the screen to cover the controller board. Do not screw anything together at this point. Install batteries and power the device on. At this point, you should see the display light up. If the display is not working as expected, carefully inspect all connection points and try again. You can control the brightness by holding Select and pressing either L or R to increase or decrease the brightness.&#x20;

![](../../assets/wD6yX3SRrSicSnnChOkyc_testingreassembly.jpg)

If everything goes smoothly than you can proceed onto reassembling the console. Insert all face buttons, the LED indicator lens, and the button membranes. You can also put all of the side pieces back on the console too.&#x20;

Please note that the display needs to be to the top left of the screen window as shown below.

![](../../assets/L7gcbmEO2UKm26FNi9QX0_screenplacement.jpg)

Place the main board into the front housing, ensuring the speaker is properly aligned with the cutout in the shell. Install the 3 J1 screws to secure the main board. From here you can finish reassembling the console.&#x20;

![No lens due to testing](../../assets/JuTc8PayqCrL2lNF4XQ3x_powerson.jpg)

If everything is functioning as expected, go ahead and complete the reassembly by replacing the rear screws. [See our disassembly guide if you need further assistance here.](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/agb-disassembly-guide)
