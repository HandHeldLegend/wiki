Is your EZ Flash giving you some trouble? Common issues we see are:

*   The cartridge is not booting.

*   The cart boots but does not make it past the main screen.

*   Freezing, glitching, or other game play issues.


### &#xD;Solutions

1\. Make sure your EZ Flash is up to date to the current version. Visit [this site ](https://www.ezflash.cn/download/)to confirm.


2\. Re-format your SD card with proper format and suggested cluster. You can re-format your SD card [here.](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/)

*   card size ≤ 2 GB - FAT/FAT16 - 32KB

*   card size ≤ 32 GB - FAT32 - 32KB

*   card size ≤ 128 GB - exFAT - 32KB or Larger

3\. Purchase and re-format a new SD card. Ideally you will want a name brand card.
