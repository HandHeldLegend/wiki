## Power Consumption

### Methodology

These tests were performed using a desktop power supply supplying 3v, 1 amp. This means that 1 amp of current is made available for consumption. Measurements are taken from the power supply which indicates how much power is drawn.

All final measurements are made by taking a baseline measurement of the Game Boy Pocket without any screen attached, then subtracting this number from the measurement taken with the screen attached.

When possible, measurements are taken to show the power consumption from minimum brightness to maximum brightness.

**The baseline measurement for power consumption was about 53mA. This is with new electrolytic capacitors and a cleaned power switch.**
