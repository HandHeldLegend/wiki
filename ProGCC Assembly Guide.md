## Video Guide:&#x20;

This guide will go over the assembly process for the ProGCC controller.&#x20;

When assembling the ProGCC you may either use an official pro controller shell, or you may buy an extra shell to assemble the controller in. Follow our [disassembly guide](https://wiki.handheldlegend.com/pro-controller-disassembly) to take apart an OEM controller.

Included are two PCBs, one for the buttons and triggers, and a main board that has the joysticks on it. There is also a ribbon connector that connects the two halves of the board like the OEM controller. *An extra ribbon cable is included with every kit.*

Place all the buttons and their membranes into the top half of the shell, then place the PCB over them.&#x20;

We will now assemble the trigger assembly. To start we will take our ribbon cable and make sure that it is fed this way through the plastic.&#x20;

We will then begin by making sure that the bumper buttons are seated, they will first slip over the straight peg, and then they will get pushed down over the clip part. You can do this on both sides or one at a time.&#x20;

We will then fit in the lower trigger portion of the cable. They share a similar mounting mechanism as the bumper buttons, they will get placed over two pegs that help hold the flexible PCB in place.&#x20;

Next is the membranes for the buttons, there are different kinds for the bumper buttons and the triggers. To start we will do the trigger membranes, they are the bigger of the two types and have the prongs on the bottom. &#x20;

They will be put over top of the trigger membrane and pulled through the two holes on either side of the metal contacts. They are slightly larger at the top to help hold the memrane onto the plastic.&#x20;

Next up is the bumper button membranes. They are the flat ones, and they have a similar mounting method as the bumper membranes. They will sit over top of one peg and clip down onto the other.&#x20;

We will now put the bumper buttons onto the trigger assembly. The bumper buttons have two tabs that will lock into place and allow the button to hinge.&#x20;

We will then put the triggers into place, they will sit down over the membranes, and a pin is inserted to help hold them in place. The trigger assembly is then finished

Add the trigger assembly on top of the board, and connect the ribbon connector and four screws.&#x20;

The main PCB just slids into the same spot as the OEM motherboard. Secure it down with the three screws as shown.&#x20;

Attach the sticks and the flex cable after screwing the board down. The flex cable **must be blue side up on both ends of the connection. **

:::hint{type="info"}
V1 cables are reversible, but V2 cables must be blue side up.

Attach both halves of the controller with the flex cable, be careful not to damage the flex cable.&#x20;

Put both halves of the contoller back together, and finish assembling the controller.&#x20;
