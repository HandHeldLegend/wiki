This guide is for the [GBA CleanJuice Battery Module](https://handheldlegend.com/products/cleanjuice-game-boy-advance-li-ion-rechargeable-battery-module?_pos=3&_sid=05bfe7003&_ss=r) and is only meant to show the soldering points needed if this mod is attempted. Please do this at your own risk, soldering experience and further research is required.

To complete this mod, you will need [an inductive coil ](https://handheldlegend.com/products/wireless-qi-power-inductive-coil?_pos=1&_sid=50dce662e&_ss=r)and a wireless charging PCB. We currently do not supply a wireless charging PCB, this will need to be sourced elsewhere.
